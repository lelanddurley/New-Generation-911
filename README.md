# New-Generation-911
A publicly created Open Source application to facilitate IP backed phone calls between first responders and people in need.



Hello everyone, 

My name is Leland Durley and I want to develop an application that makes emergency calls with first responders better. Using Web based services opens up so much more for the person making the call: retrieving their location would be much faster with web based location services, medical information about the caller could be stored on the app and sent digitally (blood type/identifying features/allergies), callers would be MUCH safer (think, if someone is coming at you with a knife and you’re able to capture their identity and have it be automatically sent to the first responders, people who are in the area could be sent images of what that person looks like, users completely unrelated to your current situation but within the area could identify who/what/where that person is and be given warnings based on their location that there might be someone who might stab them in their area! 

I’m not a programmer but I’ve looked into this issue before, I live in the United States of America and they have guidelines following the development of an application that supports web based services for first responder usage (called Next Generation 911). For at least 15 years organizations have worked to make NG 911 possible, but there’s been no new information or data out to the public. I believe that with a bunch of people from the internet we can make NG 911 happen within a month (seriously)! Here’s what we would need. If we make an application with everything below available to everyone, I believe the people would push for their local governments and representatives to adopt the already created and easily verifiable software. It’s a win/win for everybody. 


Completely Open Source application that encrypts all video, location information etc to first responders. This information gets stored on their servers and would be able to be shared (the person who the video originates from understands that they are not the owner of that video) 

Scans each telephone call for “911” OR can be run from the app (starts a 911 call) and then runs internet based program in the background.  
If user has already accepted all conditions and allowed use of everything
Runs Location services/camera automatically 
Sends first responders ongoing video footage, gps information. 
User is able to use their home screen button and do other things while on call with 911. 
First responders can send users videos to watch (like CPR how-to etc) 

If app is always storing users location- (First responders can geotag warnings (robberies, etc)


App stores First cross most important first aid videos.
